class Solution:
    
    """
    Description: Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string s
    
    Time Complexity: O(n^2) for both solutions
    Space Complexity: O(n^2) for DP solution, O(1) for two-pointers
    where n is length of the given string
    
    Approach: using DP matrix
    1. Initiate a DP matrix with n x n size (fill with boolean False)
    2. iterate through the string and at every index, iterate from the begining to apply the following:
       - if the character is same and previous substring is found to be a palindrome (from previous sub problem), replace dp value to True
       - if character is same and difference of indices is less than 2, replace dp value to True
    3. store a maximum length parameter and update and store the start and end indices
    4. return the substring using #3
    
    Approach: Optimized (using two-pointers)
    1. for each character extend the indices until palindrome exist
       - update the maximum length if get better outcome
       - special precaution for odd number of strings (starting indices needs to be on the character and the next)
    2. maintain a starting index and return substring using start index and the maximum length
